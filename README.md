# Kickstarter - this project explored the use of excel, in relation to the use of pivot tables and "if" function.

For the first project, we were supposed to establish the relationship between outcomes and launch dates of the fundraising. Looking at that relationship for year and outcomes was more informative and relevant than looking at months. What is clear is that years 2014 - 2016 were the most successful for fundraising. However, there was also almost the same number of failures during those years. However, compared to all the other years, 2014-2016 indicated higher fundaraising activity than the other years.
For the second project, a new table was created with the goals stratified by ranges of values. The goal was to establish the percentage of successful, failed and cancelled outcomes based on the initial fundraising goal. The function COUNTIFS was used for this project. However, despite my syntax being correct, only the first row yielded values that not zero. Obviously, I will have to go back to this project with the TAs and find out what the source of this error was.
